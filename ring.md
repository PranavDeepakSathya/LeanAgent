> [!proposition] multiplication by zero in a ring
Let $R$ be a ring. then for each $r \in R$, $0_{R}r = 0_{R}$.  



`\begin{proof}`
Notice that $0_{R}r = (0_{R} + 0_{R})r = 0_{R}r + 0_{R}r$ add the additive inverse of $0_{R}r$ to the leftmost and the right most sides of the equation.
`\end{proof}`
